In addition to the above comparison operator Python uses:

is: Returns true if both variables are the same object(x is y)
is not: Returns true if both variables are not the same object(x is not y)
in: Returns True if the queried list contains a certain item(x in y)
not in: Returns True if the queried list doesn't have a certain item(x in y)
